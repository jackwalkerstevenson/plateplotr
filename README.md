# plateplotr
Plotting plate reader data

This script is intended for reading dose-response data created on a plate reader, normalizing the data, fitting a dose-response curve and plotting it in the style of Prism.

NOTE as of 2023-04 plateplotr is in active development and depends on jackwalkerstevenson/doseplotr, and as such is not usable on its own. doseplotr is also in active development and is planned to supersede plateplotr in the near future.

Written by Jack Stevenson, Shokat lab, UCSF in 2022â€“23.
